Student Grades Management System
This repository contains the code for a basic Student Grades Management System developed as a semester final project for the 1st semester in the BSCS program. The program is written in C++ and demonstrates basic concepts of arrays, loops, sorting and conditional statements.

Project Overview:
The program initializes arrays to store student roll numbers, midterm marks, final marks, and attendance for a class of 15 students. It then calculates the total percentage for each student based on their midterm and final marks, assigns grades according to predefined criteria, and outputs the results.
The program also sort the result with roll numbers,grades,marks etc it also increment and delete elements from the array by using specific conditions.
A menu is displayed in output that makes it easy to use. 

Features:
Initialize Arrays: Stores roll numbers, midterm marks, final marks, and attendance records.
Calculate Percentages: Computes the total percentage for each student.
Assign Grades: Assigns grades based on the calculated percentages:
A for percentages 86 and above
B for percentages between 73 and 85
C for percentages between 60 and 72
D for percentages between 50 and 59
F for percentages below 50

Usage:
To run the program, compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang) and execute the resulting binary.
sh
g++ Source.cpp -o StudentGrades
./StudentGrades
